# Tic Tac Toe Game
# Tic-tac-toe (also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a
# paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking t
# he spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.

# Check conditions for game over
# The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a
# horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
# Players soon discover that best play from both parties leads to a draw.
